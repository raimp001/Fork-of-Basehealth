- ✅ Proper empty states everywhere

**Files Cleaned**:
- `app/api/medical-records/route.ts` - Removed all mock patient data
- `app/api/caregivers/search/route.ts` - Removed all 5 seed caregivers
- APIs now return `isEmpty: true` with helpful messages

#### 2. ✅ UI IMPROVED - Minimalistic & Reactive

- ✅ Beautiful card designs with hover effects

#### 4. ✅ API IMPROVEMENTS

  "mockCount": 0,
  "message": "No caregivers currently available. Please check back later or apply to become a caregiver!",
